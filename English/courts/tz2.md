#### To verify trademark infringement in case of using a domain name, two conditions are checked: the similarity to the point of confusion and unfair use
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 03 November 2011 in case no. A40-73876/2011*
```
When addressing the question of whether the violated the plaintiff's right to a trademark when use by the 
defendant domain name, the court checks for two conditions: first, the presence of similarity to the degree 
of confusion of the domain name with a trademark, and second, unfair use of a domain name in relation to 
goods or services, for individualization of which the trademark is registered.
```

<br>

#### Domain names have become a means of performing the function of a trademark
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 03 November 2011 in case no. A40-73876/2011*
```
When choosing domain names for the Internet, owners of information resources stop at the maximum
simple and logical names (word, group of letters, etc.), which are usually associated with consumers directly
with a specific participant in the economic turnover or their activities. Domain names have actually been 
transformed in the means performing function of the trademark which gives the chance to distinguish 
respectively goods and services of some legal entities and individuals from similar goods and services 
of other legal entities or individuals.
```

<br>

#### Domain names containing trademarks or trade names have commercial value
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 03 November 2011 in case no. A40-73876/2011*
```
Domain names that contain trademarks or trade names have commercial value.
```

<br>

#### The right holder has the exclusive right to use the trademark on the Internet
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 03 November 2011 in case no. A40-73876/2011*
```
The plaintiff as the right holder has an exclusive (priority) right to use own trademark in any 
manner not contrary to the law, including on the Internet.
```

*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 28 may 2012 in case no. A40-25696/2012*
```
Thus, it should be noted that the plaintiff as the right holder has an exclusive (priority) right to use its 
trademark in any manner not contrary to the law, including the Internet.
```

<br>

#### Similarity to the degree of confusion between a trademark and a domain name is established by visual comparison
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 03 November 2011 in case no. A40-73876/2011*
```
Thus, the court, assessing the evidence, concluded that the visual comparison of symbols are located in domain 
names "higer.ru" and "хайгер.рф", with the trademark of the plaintiff, the similarity to the extent of confusion 
of its individual elements is the place to be, which is a violation of the exclusive rights of the plaintiff.
```

<br>

#### The domain name is identical or confusingly similar if it is a transcription of the word that is the trademark
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 03 November 2011 in case no. A40-73876/2011*
```
Domain name "higer.ru" and trademark are made of some letters of the alphabet and their reading, and it develops 
a strong belief about their close relationship, at the same time, the domain name "хайгер.рф" at its core is 
a transcription of the word ""HIGER" translated into Russian, which is not disputed by the parties in the case 
and is obvious.
```

*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 28 November 2011 in case no. A40-40435/2011*
```
Domain names MIRAX.ME and MIRAX.TV, registered by the defendant, include the word "MIRAX" in English
language, completely identical to the degree of confusion to the trademark MIRAX, as well as the trademark 
"МИРАКС" in Russian language, which corresponds to the degree of confusion of the English transcription 
of the word "MIRAX".
```

<br>

#### The same font in the domain name and trademark is a sign of their close connection
*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 08 April 2011 in case no. A40-152587/2010*
```
The disputed designation of the domain name and the protected trademark are executed by one font of the 
Latin alphabet, and at their reading it develops a strong belief about their close relationship.
```

<br>

*Decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of 28 may 2012 in case no. A40-25696/2012*
```
The disputed designation of the domain name and the protected trademark are executed by one font of the Latin 
alphabet, and at their reading it develops a strong belief about their close relationship.
```

<br>

#### In case of a conflict of trademark and domain name rights, the name and content of the site are analyzed
*The decision of the Moscow Arbitration court as of April 4, 2013 in the case № A40-162939/2012*
```
The Plaintiff owned trademarks and the domain name "bolshoi.me" are similar to the point of confusion, that 
follows from visual examination of the symbols.  The name of the website and its content are used for the 
realization of theater tickets, i.e. in the same field of activity as the right holder.
